# D-Link Exploit
The exploit exists in the devices server, alphapd, when processing `wireless.htm` 
prior to displaying it to the user. If `WEPEncryption` is provided in the 
URL this leads to a buffer overflow if the value is longer than 0x28 bytes. A 
URL of the form:
 
     http://IP_ADDRESS/wireless.htm?WEPEncryption=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB

will exercise the exploit and begin executing at `0x42424242`. 

**Note: The exploit requires credentials to be successful.**
**Default credentials are admin with a blank password.**

## exploit.py
Full exploit that takes advantage of a buffer overflow in the alphapd server to 
execute an arbitrary command on the device. It has been tested on the DCS-5020L
with all available versions of the firmware as well as the most recent firmware
of the DCS-930L. More devices and versions can be added by reading the comments
in the [overflow](DlinkExploit/overflows/overflow.py) file. I might add more devices 
and versions as time permits, but it's not a high priority. The initial commit of
this project has some simpler Python2 examples. 

## Vulnerable Devices
Below is the list of devices effected by this exploit. All versions of the firmware
are currently vulnerable. 

**DCS-930L**

**DCS-931L**

**DCS-932L**

**DCS-933L**

**DCS-934L**

**DCS-5009L**

**DCS-5010L**

**DCS-5020L**

**DCS-5025L**

**DCS-5030L**
